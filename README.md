# California Housing Price Prediction Using Python and Machine Learning

The aim of this project is to analyze California housing data and predict median house values using regression models. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the development of predictive models to:

1. Understand key factors influencing housing prices, such as location, median income, and proximity to the ocean.
2. Visualize trends and correlations in the data.
3. Train and compare machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to accurately predict housing prices.

This analysis can be valuable for real estate market insights and for making data-driven decisions in housing investments.
